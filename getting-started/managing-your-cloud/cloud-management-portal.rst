Cloud management portal
=======================

.. tip::

   If you need many users with personal accounts to manage your infrastructure, `OpenStack Horizon <openstack-horizon>`__ is
   a good solution for this as the cloud management portal only supports the main user. 

In the `cloud management portal <https://portal.binero.cloud>`__ you will be able to setup your cloud infrastructure effortlessly
and quick! You an access it using single sign on from the `account management portal <account-management-portal>`__.

To use single sign on, press **Login to the cloud portal** on the first page (where you end up directly after logging in) in
the `account management portal <account-management-portal>`__.

The cloud management portal focuses on ease of use and has support for the main features of the platform while leaving out some of
the more advanced features.

For information on how to complete certain tasks in the cloud management portal, see the sections in this documentation.

In our `getting started guide </getting-started/launching-an-instance>`_ we explain how to use the cloud management portal to setup
your first instance with a router and a floating IP which is a good way to start out using the platform.
