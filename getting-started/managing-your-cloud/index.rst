Managing your cloud
===================

The Binero cloud platform has multiple interfaces to manage your services each
with its unique features and benefits.

.. important::

   There will be situations where the cloud management portal and OpenStack Horizon
   or the OpenStack terminal client shows different things.

   This is because they use different users. We therefore recommend not altering
   between tools unless needed.

.. tip::

   If you are starting out from scratch, we recommend using
   `our Cloud management portal <cloud-management-portal>`_ to get going!

- `Account management portal <account-management-portal>`_ - Account and billing,
  intended for the administrator of the account or users working with invoices and costs.

- `Cloud management portal <cloud-management-portal>`_ - Essential cloud infrastructure,
  intended for technical users that want to setup infrastructure with minimum effort.

- `OpenStack Horizon <openstack-horizon>`_ - Advanced cloud infrastructure, intended for
  technicians and engineers working with more advanced implementation as well as when needing
  personal accounts.

- `OpenStack terminal client <openstack-terminal-client>`_ - Advanced cloud infrastructure via
  terminal, same as Horizon but terminal based.

- `OpenStack API </openstack-api>`_ - Infrastructure as code and third party implementations, intended
  for programmers that want to implement infrastructure as code projects using the platform or when
  using third party applications.

See the walk-through of the cloud management portal.
