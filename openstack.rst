OpenStack
=========

Binero cloud runs on `OpenStack <https://www.openstack.org>`_ which is an umbrella ecosystem of
open source software that together can be used to build public and private cloud infrastructure.

Release
-------

Binero cloud is running the **Caracal** coordinated release of OpenStack. We strive to keep updated
and our goal is to never fall more than two releases behind the newest release and at the same time
not introducing software not yet considered production ready.

Official documentation
----------------------

The official OpenStack documentation is a good place to get detailed information about the services
and their APIs.
