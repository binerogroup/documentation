MTU
===

MTU or ``Maximum Transmission Unit``, is a measure of how large individual packets (or frames) can be.

The concept of *Jumbo frames* essentially means supporting an MTU on an interface that is larger
than 1500 bytes which is the standard size (Ethernet) of on a network interface in operating systems. 

Fragmentation
-------------

Since the standard MTU size is 1500 bytes, using a larger MTU could have some impact for packets
that have a destination that is outside the scope of the local network (where the MTU is possible
to control).

For these scenarios, **fragmentation** is the normal solution.

Fragmentation means that an intermediate router might split a packet into many packets, should
it need to egress onto a network with a smaller MTU as next hop.

The receiving server will later on have to reassemble the packet. This process happens in the background
and is not something that needs to be actively managed by an administrator, some applications does not work
well with fragmentation so there is an option to disallow it by setting the ``DF`` bit on a frame. 

DF stands for *Don't Fragment* and essentially tells every router involved to avoid fragmentation. The alternative
to fragmentation, when using a larger MTU than 1500, is dropping the packet and send back a  ICMP message with
code *Fragmentation needed*.

Because of this, its important to understand the concept of MTU, especially when using an MTU different
from 1500 bytes.

Here is an example of an ICMP reply to a packet that was to big, as captured using ``tcpdump``: 

::

    17:54:49.979998 IP 1.2.3.4 > 5.6.7.8: ICMP 1.2.3.4 unreachable - need to frag (mtu 1450), length 556

Here is an example of a packet that has the DF bit set: 

::

    6:30:17.621056 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 61, id 39062, offset 0, flags [DF], proto TCP (6), length 4148) 4.5.6.7.443 > 1.2.3.4.34862: Flags [P.], cksum 0x0bdb (incorrect -> 0x3f5f), seq 1:4097, ack 321, win 227, options [nop,nop,TS val 955793242 ecr 3076045005], length 4096

Notice the ``DF`` flag - this indicates that we should not fragment the packet . Also notice the length
indicating that the packet is 4096 bits long and as such, will not pass a standard 1500 MTU interface as
fragmentation is not allowed.

MTU discovery
-------------

The standard for discovering the smallest MTU on a link called `Path MTU Discovery <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_MTU_Discovery>`_
or PMTUD.

This enables servers to discover the smallest MTU by setting the DF flag and sending packets until it's forwarded
correctly. It relies on ICMP which not all service providers and network operators honour so its not 100% certain
that it will work.

MTU in Binero cloud
-------------------

Since Binero cloud uses virtual networking, the MTU size given when using :doc:`subnet/dhcp` on your
:doc:`subnet <subnet/index>` to assign addresses is 1450 bytes.

This is because the VXLAN (network virtualization used) encapsulation needs 50 bytes of the frames
available 1500 bytes.

The underlying interface on the physical servers managing compute and networking in the platform uses the standard
of 1500 bytes and so the instances need to have a smaller MTU to also provide enough room for the host to encapsulate
the frame before sending it onto the network.

.. note::

   It's possible to set any MTU on your interface but using an MTU larger than 1450 will cause
   dropping of your packets. See below for more information.

MTU caveats
-----------

When using a different MTU than standard (as is the case in Binero cloud), it becomes important to understand the
possible effects of that.

If you only have your compute instances and they use 1450 MTU, generally everything will work well. If you for
example use **bridge interfaces** on your instances to connect to local containers (or some other use-case), which in
turn use the default 1500 MTU then this might have adverse effects. 

.. important::

   Use only 1450 MTU on all interfaces that are setup on your instances. 

Larger MTU
^^^^^^^^^^

Larger than 1500 MTU is normally used in scenarios where you need to send data quickly. It causes less data
on the wire when using a large MTU because you need to send less packets to transfer the same amount of data.

For example ISCSI or NFS (storage protocols that transfers large amounts of data) both grain performance by
using larger MTU. Larger MTU than 1450 is not possible to use in the cloud platform.

Smaller MTU
^^^^^^^^^^^

The only real reason to use a smaller MTU is if you use a network protocol that needs room for
more data in its header added to packets.

Below are some examples:

- GRE (IP Protocol 47) (RFC 2784) adds 24 bytes (20 byte IPv4 header, 4 byte GRE header)

- 6in4 encapsulation (IP Protocol 41, RFC 4213) adds 20 bytes

- 4in6 encapsulation (e.g. DS-Lite RFC 6333) adds 40 bytes

- IPsec encryption performed by the DMVPN adds 73 bytes for ESP-AES-256 and ESP-SHA-HMAC

- MPLS adds 4 bytes for each label in the stack

- IEEE 802.1Q tag adds 4 bytes (Q-in-Q would add 8 bytes)

- VXLAN adds 50 bytes

- OTV adds 42 bytes

- LISP adds 36 bytes for IPv4 and 56 bytes for IPv6 encapsulation

- NVGRE adds 42 bytes

- STT adds 54 bytes

Taking into account the extra data from the encapsulation, gives you less space to send data and the
max size you can send decreases for the payload data to fit the extra header.

General recommendations
-----------------------

The mechanisms in TCP to overcome MTU differences is using PMTUD which you cannot trust due to
normalization of blocking ICMP traffic for IPv4.

That said, generally you would want to ensure that you **do not use more than 1450 MTU in total** on the platform.

If you need to use encapsulation, take this into account. A good way to test is using ping with the DF flag set and
by manually specifying the size of the ping packet.

You can do this on Linux:

::

    ping -M do 1.2.3.4 -s 1500

And on Windows

::

    ping 1.2.3.4 -l 1500 â€“f

Above example would ping with 1500 bytes with DF set and would return a fail if that did not work.

Remember that ping uses both ICMP and IP which both add to the size of the packets (20 and 8 bytes) so
even sending 1450 bytes with DF set to an IP in Binero cloud will not work, ``1450 - 28 = 1422`` bytes will.

In conclusion, keeping MTU consistent to 1450 across all interfaces will ensure functionality.
