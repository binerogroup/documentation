==============
OpenVPN Server
==============

Use cases
---------
The use cases covered by this service template are for creating an OpenVPN
server running in a pfSense instance which provides access to a private network
used by your cloud instances.

This may be used to allow secure access to your instances without requiring
security groups for client IP ranges and external access through a public IP for
each instance.

The default configuration allows any number of clients to access the VPN
service using the same credentials (one user certificate + the TLS key).
All required certificates are automatically generated (and are thus unique)
for each deployment of the service. Cipher selections and algorithms used for
the generated keys follow the guidelines laid out by the `CNSA suite
<https://apps.nsa.gov/iaarchive/programs/iad-initiatives/cnsa-suite.cfm>`_ for
protecting data at "TOP SECRET" level.

For even higher security, you may choose to add user specific credentials
through the pfSense control panel - see :ref:`openvpn-unique-credentials` for
instructions.


Deployment
----------
Log on to the `Binero cloud portal <https://portal.binero.cloud/>`_.
If you have not already created a private network, you will need to do that by
selecting :menuselection:`Networking --> Networks` from the menu pane on the
left. Create a network by pressing :guilabel:`+` in the lower right corner of
the main pane and enter an appropriate name for your private network (this is
purely cosmetic).
If you want to pick an availability zone other than ``europe-se-1a``, you may
add a hint for this here. Keep :guilabel:`Admin state up` checked and click
:guilabel:`Create`.

Go to :menuselection:`Service Catalogue --> Services`.
Click :guilabel:`+` in the lower right corner of the main pane and pick the
OpenVPN service and click :guilabel:`Next`.

Here you will pick a suitable name that will be prefixed to all resources that
will be deployed by this template. Select your SSH keys and enter one or more
(comma separated) IP-ranges in CIDR-notation that will be allowed to access
the pfSense WebUI and SSH server for administrative access (this can be changed
later, see :ref:`openvpn-admin-ranges`). You may enter ``0.0.0.0/0`` here to
allow administrative access from ANYWHERE (not recommended).

Select the availability zone where your private network is located (if you did
not specifically pick a different zone, this will be the default
``europe-se-1a``) and pick your private network. You can then choose a flavor
to use for the pfSense instance. The default flavor should be good enough for
most use cases.

After clicking :guilabel:`Launch` you should see the service stack listed with
the status ``CREATE IN PROGRESS``. Allow a few minutes for service creation to
complete (you may have to refresh your browser window to see updated status).
After the service stack has been created (Stack status: ``CREATE COMPLETE``),
you may open its info view by clicking the "card". Here you will be presented
with a URL to the pfSense WebUI. Copy the value from the ``mgmt_url`` output and
open the URL in your browser. As the WebUI uses a self-signed certificate by
default, your browser will display a warning before opening the site (select
:menuselection:`Advanced --> Accept the Risk and Continue` if you are using
Mozilla Firefox). Default username/password for the WebUI is
``admin``/``pfsense``.

After login you may want to change the default password to something else. The
WebUI will provide guidance for how to do this in a notice close to the top of
the page).

.. _openvpn-client-export:

In order to access your new VPN service, you need to download the client
configuration file. Open :menuselection:`VPN --> OpenVPN --> Client Export` in
pfSense WebUI. Scroll down to OpenVPN clients and pick a configuration suitable
for your client software. If you are running Windows, we recommend picking
:guilabel:`Current Windows Installer/64-bit` if you don't already have OpenVPN
installed or :guilabel:`Inline configurations/Most Clients` if you already have
an OpenVPN client installed. For Mac OS X, we recommend installing
`Viscosity <https://www.sparklabs.com/viscosity/>`_ and using the configuration
:guilabel:`Viscosity (Mac OS X and Windows)/Viscosity Inline Config`.


Connecting to OpenVPN server (Windows)
--------------------------------------
If did not install OpenVPN by using the installer generated by pfSense, you can
import the inline configuration file by just opening it.

You can now connect by opening :menuselection:`Start --> OpenVPN GUI`,
right-clicking the OpenVPN GUI icon in Windows' taskbar notification area,
selecting the menu matching the
filename of the configuration file you just downloaded and clicking
:guilabel:`Connect`.


.. _openvpn-unique-credentials:

Configuring pfSense to use separate credentials per user
--------------------------------------------------------
Open :menuselection:`VPN --> OpenVPN` in pfSense WebUI and click the pen symbol
under the :guilabel:`Actions` column in the server list.
If you want each user to have to enter a username and password in addition to
authenticating with unique certificates, you may change the
:guilabel:`Server mode` setting to :guilabel:`Remote Access ( SSL/TLS + User
Auth )`. Scroll down to :guilabel:`Duplicate Connection` and disable it if you
only want to allow one simultaneous connection per user. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

Now you may create some users my opening
:menuselection:`System --> User Manager`. Click :guilabel:`Add` and enter an
appropriate username and password (these will only matter for OpenVPN
authentication if "User Auth" was added to the Server Mode above) to create a
user certificate and enter the username as :guilabel:`Descriptive name`.

The new user configuration(s) can now be downloaded from the
:guilabel:`Client Export` page, see :ref:`Deployment <openvpn-client-export>`.
Distribute the unique configurations to each user.


Allowing OpenVPN clients to access private cloud instances
----------------------------------------------------------
Each instance that you want to access has to have a network interface connected
to the same private network as the OpenVPN instance. After that you may add the
security group :samp:`OpenVPN-{name}-access` to each instance that VPN clients
should have access to.


.. _openvpn-admin-ranges:

Changing administrative IP-addresses
------------------------------------
Log on to the `Binero cloud portal <https://portal.binero.cloud/>`_ and open
:menuselection:`Networking --> Security Groups`. Open the group named
:samp:`OpenVPN-{name chosen during deployment}-management` and add/remove rules
for IP ranges permitted to access TCP port 22, 80 and 443.
