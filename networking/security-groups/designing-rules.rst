Designing security group rules
==============================

Recommendations
---------------

Below are some key points to take into consideration when designing security group
rules (firewall rules) in Binero cloud that will lead to a more secure application.

- Its recommended to make the rule as granular as possible. If you for example want to
  give access to a web server, then just add a rule for HTTP (tcp/80) and HTTPS
  (tcp/443), don't also allow access to UDP or any other ports.

- Lock down the source IP when the rule is for management, don't expose services
  that are not needed to be provide as your service. Only leave rules that give
  access to internet facing services from any source.

- Use the custom rules that enables you to add a destination port. Don't use the
  all open security group even if its internal. Its a large gain in security to
  just add access to the services that's needed as vulnerable services are one of
  the biggest reasons for security breaches. The fewer exposed, the better, including
  on internal networks.

- Since you apply your security groups per instance you wont set a destination when
  creating rules. The destination (or source if its an egress rule) depends on which
  instances you add your security groups to. Take care to not add a rule to an instance
  that gives to much access. Rather create more security groups with more granular rules
  so that you reduce your instances exposure. 

- Remember egress or ingress (more info on the :doc:`index` page). Generally speaking, the
  you should add as few ingress rules as possible since security becomes worse when providing
  ingress access, we recommend that you design to have few and that they have a specific purpose.

- If you still have the `default group <index.html#default-settings>`__ activated on your
  instances, you do not also need to provide access for your internal systems to reach each
  other. For an easier setup, we recommend keeping the default group (as it will emulate a
  traditional network where all local machines will reach each other). For a more secure
  solution, we also recommend adding security groups for internal access and removing the
  default group. **We do not recommending mixing the two options as that will be a less
  predictable (and more complex to understand) design**.

- When doing many subnets to allow for different security zones (the need for this is
  negated by using proper security groups that replace the default group as that will give
  you security between your instances on the same network as well), remember that the default
  group will leave your internal networks open to each other even though they are traversing
  a router.

- Create security groups based on use cases. A use case might be a web server and another might
  be a database server. You should design the rules for each use case with the instance type in
  mind. Remember that its possible to add many security groups to any instance. Its much easier
  to have many granular security groups instead of a single complex security group.

- ``0.0.0.0/0`` means *the entire internet* when using it as a destination. We only recommend
  using this to provide access to a service that should indeed be globally reachable.

- Rules are by default stateful. This means when we receive an ingress request and it's accepted,
  the *return traffic* (the traffic that the answering service sends as a reply to the request) is
  also allowed, irrespectively of wether that traffic flow is explicitly defined.

  - This is a standard behaviour in a firewall. If you want to create a non stateful (stateless)
    rule, you can create the group using the :doc:`terminal client <openstack-terminal-client>` and
    the flag ``--stateless``. A stateless rule would only work in a single direction (egress or
    ingress). We generally recommend stateful rules but for some use-cases (for example asymmetrical
    routing where you would not send the return traffic the same path), stateless rules might be
    required.

.. tip::

   The best way to ensure that you have correctly applied your rules is by testing. You can test by using
   the ``nmap`` command that can perform a port scan.

   For instance ``nmap -T4 1.2.3.4`` would scan the server with IP 1.2.3.4 (the -T4 flag limits the timeout
   per port to 10 ms which speeds up the otherwise slow process). The output will be a list of open ports.

   Remember to scan both from the inside (using your internal instances against their internal IP addresses)
   and by using for example your workstation (against the floating IP that expose your services) to get the
   public internet perspective.

   We recommend doing scans after setting up or changing your security groups to make sure the actual result
   corresponds with your expectations. Binero protects it's network against malicious traffic, we don't
   recommend doing excessive port scanning as that can trigger our intrusion detection system to block you.

Available parameters
--------------------

The following section shows what parameters you can use to create security groups. Note that not all
parameters will be available from the GUI, some might require using the :doc:`terminal client <openstack-terminal-client>`

We provide the parameters to the terminal client in the parenthesis below.

- Remote IP (``--remote-ip``) - Remote IP address or IP range (may use :doc:`CIDR notation <../subnet/subnet-format>`,
  default for IPv4 rule: 0.0.0.0/0, default for IPv6 rule: ::/0).

- Remote Group (``--remote-group``) - Remote security group (name or ID). Instead of IP, you could use a remote
  group to decide from where the traffic originates.

- Destination port (``--dst-port``) - Destination port, may be a single port or a starting and ending port range
  137:139. Required for IP protocols TCP and UDP.

- Protocol (``--protocol``) - IP protocol â€“ AH, DCCP, EGP, ESP, GRE, ICMP, IGMP, ipv6-encap, ipv6-frag, ipv6-icmp, ipv6-nonxt,
  ipv6-opts, ipv6-route, PGM, RSVP, SCTP, TCP, UDP, UDP-Lite, VRRP or a integer representations (0-255) or any (-1), default is 
  any (all protocols).

- ICMP typ (``--icmp-type``) - ICMP type for ICMP IP protocols.

- ICMP code (``--icmp-code``) - ICMP code for ICMP IP protocols.

- Direction (``--ingress`` or ``--egress``) - Rule applies to incoming or outgoing network traffic (incoming is
  default).

- IP version (``--ethertype``) - whether to use IPv4 or IPv6; default is based on IP protocol.
