Network API
===========
To manage networking functions to for instance launch a :doc:`router/index` via the OpenStack API you need to use the Neutron API. We do not provide a complete documentation for how to do API calls but rather `link to the correct official documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/network/>`_. 

.. Note::
	Please read our `general OpenStack API documentation :doc:`/openstack-api` as a good starting point for working with the API.
