Private Network

If you want to provision a new :doc:`network </networking/network/index>`, this convenience
function will help you.

Additional info on how to get started with networking is in our
:doc:`/getting-started/launching-an-instance` guide. 

To setup the service, first follow the general instructions on our
:doc:`index` page. Then follow these instructions: 

- Give your service a name and optionally a description.

- Select which :doc:`availability zone </compute/regions-and-availability-zones>` you want to
  provision in. We recommend *europe-se-1a* if you are unsure.

- Select a :doc:`subnet range </networking/subnet/subnet-format>` to use.

- Leave remaining items and press **Create**
