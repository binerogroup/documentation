Our support organization is available via telephone or email ticket
during office hours. Our contact information is available `on our website <https://binero.com/en/contact/>`_.

We always recommend creating a ticket when requesting support as this
will enable us to route your question to the most appropriate resource
in our organization and provide traceability for future reference.

Our support organization will happily you in working with the cloud
platform and share our knowledge about best practices for both using
our cloud platform and for your applications and services.
