Quotas
======

Public cloud offerings are at risk for fraud and abuse accounts by individuals
looking to consume our cloud platform at no cost.

To limit the impact of potential misuse of the cloud platform, we enforce quotas
on the amount of resources that can be provisioned per account.

These quotas can be adjusted to accommodate your needs by
:doc:`contacting our support </general/getting-support>`.

Please ensure that you've entered relevant details on your account and has paid
for at least one months of usage.
