Getting support
===============
Our support-staff is available via phone or ticket during office hours. Our contact information is always available via our website on https://binero.com/kontakt/.

We always recommend using a ticket when requesting support as this will enable us to route your question to the most appropriate resource in our support organisation as well as provides traceability for future reference. In order to create a ticket, either mail us (using the contact information for support on our website) or fill out our support form which is available in the account management portal under "support" in the side menu. Here you can also see your historic support cases.

Our support-staff will happily assist you in how to work with the platform. When possible, we are also happy to share our knowledge about best practises with setups both in the platform and on the actual installation.
