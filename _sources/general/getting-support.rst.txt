Getting support
===============

Our support organization is available via phone or ticket during office hours. Our contact information is available `via our website on <https://binero.com/kontakt/>`_.

We always recommend creating a ticket when requesting support as this will enable us to route your question to the most appropriate resource in our organization and provide traceability for future reference.

In order to create a ticket, either mail us (using the contact information for support on our website) or fill out our support form available in the :doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/account-management-portal`
under the **Support** button in the left-side menu, you can see a complete history of your support cases on this page.

Our support organization will happily you in working with the cloud platform and share our knowledge about best practices, both regarding the cloud platform and your application/use-case.
