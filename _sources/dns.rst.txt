DNS
===

General concept
---------------

Using our DNS feature, you can use the platform to control your DNS (domain) zones. In order to start using the feature, first add one or more zones, add the pointers (A, MX, etc) and finally re-point the NS pointers to our DNS servers which are: 

- ns.binero.eu.
- ns.binero.se.
- ns.binero.com.

This final step is done using your registrars system. Your registrar is the company you pay to register and renew your domain-name. Binero does not offer this service. 

.. note:: Bineros nameservers (that is, the servers that answer the DNS queries) are not hosted with Binero but with Netnod (https://www.netnod.se/dns/dns-anycast). By default, the DNS service does not provide anycasting capabilities but if you need that, please contact our support and we can help enable it.
