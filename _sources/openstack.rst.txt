OpenStack
=========

Binero cloud runs on `OpenStack <https://www.openstack.org>`_ which is an umbrella ecosystem of open source software that together can be used to build public and private cloud infrastructure.

Release
-------

Binero cloud is running the **Zed** coordinated release of OpenStack. We strive to keep updated and our goal is to never fall more than two releases behind the newest release and at the same time not introducing
software not yet considered production ready.

Official documentation
