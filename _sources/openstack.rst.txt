OpenStack
=========
Binero.Cloud runs on `OpenStack <https://www.openstack.org>`_ which is a packaging of OpenSource based services and applications that together make up a complete cloud infrastructure suite.

Version
-------
Binero.Cloud currently runs version "Yoga" of OpenStack. We strive to keep up-to-date and our aim is to not fall more than two versions behind current while not introducing code which is not considered production ready.
