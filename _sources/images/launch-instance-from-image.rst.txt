==========================
Launch instance from image
==========================

When :doc:`snapshotting </storage/snapshots/index>` and entire instance, the end result is an :doc:`image <index>`. Restoring from a snapshot (assuming the entire instance was restored) is then the same as creating an instance from a private image.

When restoring an entire instance from a snapshot, which might be the case if for instance an upgrade failed post snapshot and you want to revert to the previous state, you would create a new instance from the image that was generated. This is a good method because it allows you to safely ensure that your new instance is up and running before deleting the old one (and not doing major changes to the only copy of the image).

.. note:: While there is a feature in the cloud management portal to do an in place restore to the current instance, we *do not recommend it*, but rather that you follow below guide to create a new instance from the image. 

Please follow our below guide from creating an instance from a private image using our various tools.

Cloud management portal
-----------------------

To create a snapshot using the :doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/cloud-management-portal`, follow these steps: 

- Press "Compute" and then "Images" in the sidebar menu.
- On the image that you want to use as base, press the small arrow "create from image". 
- Enter a name.
- Select a :doc:`flavor </compute/flavors>` under the "configuration" field.
- Choose and :doc:`availability zone </compute/regions-and-availability-zones>`.
- If applicable choose an :doc:`ssh-key </compute/ssh-keys>`.
- Choose a :doc:`private subnet </networking/router/private-subnet/index>`.
- Press "create". 

OpenStack Horizon
-----------------

To create a snapshot using :doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/openstack-horizon`, follow these steps: 

- Under "project", click "Compute" and then "Images" in the sidebar menu.
- Press "launch" to the right on the row of the image.
- Follow the remainder of the instructions in our :doc:`/compute/launching-an-instance/openstack-horizon` guide.

OpenStack Terminal Client
-------------------------

To create a snapshot using the :doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/openstack-terminal-client`, follow these steps:

- Run this command: ``openstack image list --private``, save the name of the image you want to create a new instance from. 
- Follow the instructions in our :doc:`/compute/launching-an-instance/openstack-terminal-client` guide, replacing the ``--image`` value from the public image in the example to your private image.
