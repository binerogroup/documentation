Detach a volume
===============

If you want to save a volume (when deleting the instance) for later or just remove it from an instance, you must first detach it. This means "un-hook it" from the instance so that its no longer usable. A boot disk (that is, the disk that stores the instances operating system) *cannot be detached*. If you want to save such a volume, the workflow would be:

- :doc:`Snapshot <../snapshots/index>` the volume.
- :doc:`Create a new volume from the snapshot <../snapshots/create-volume-from-snapshot>`.
- (optionally) Delete the original instance with its volume.

Because of this, volumes that are non-detachable (for being boot drives) will not give that option in the cloud management portal - and will produce an error when trying to detach in OpenStack Horizon or via the OpenStack terminal client.  

.. important:: While its possible, we don't recommend detaching a volume on a running VM as it could impact the data integrity if its not properly unmounted.

Cloud management portal
-----------------------

To detach a volume using the :doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/cloud-management-portal`, follow these steps: 

- Press "Compute" and then "Instances" in the sidebar menu.
- Press the instance that you want to resize.
- Press the "Volumes" tab.
- Press the small chain-link icon with a line over to the right next to the volume you want to remove. If there isn't such an icon, then the volume cannot be removed.  

OpenStack Horizon
-----------------

To detach a volume using :doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/openstack-horizon`, follow these steps: 

- Under "project", click "compute" and then "instances" in the sidebar menu.
- Press the name of the instance from which you want to remove a volume.
- At the bottom, under the "volumes attached" section, press the volume you want to detach.
- At the top right, press the dropdown and select "Manage Attachments". 
- Press "Detach volume" on the row of the instance. 
- If you get an error, most likely the volume is a boot volume and cannot be detached (see above).

OpenStack Terminal Client
-------------------------

To detach a volume using the :doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/openstack-terminal-client`, follow these steps:

- Run this command: ``openstack server list``, save the name of the instance to which the volume you want to extend is connected.
- Run this command: ``openstack server volume list [NAME_OF_INSTANCE]``, replacing the name with that from previous step.
- Run this command: ``openstack server remove volume [INSTANCE_ID] [VOLUME_ID]``, replacing the items in angle brackets with the "Server ID" and "Volume ID" from the output of the previous command. 
- If you get an error, most likely the volume is a boot volume and cannot be detached (see above).
