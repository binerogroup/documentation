Object locking
==============

.. note:: :doc:`Versioning <versioning>` of objects are implicitly enabled when object locking is enabled, locking is enforced for the version of the object.

Object locking concept
----------------------

Object storage is often used in use-cases where objects are stored once and read many times. The objects saved are seldom (if ever) edited but should remain available. To guarantee that an object is not (accidentally or intentionally) deleted, locking can be configured. When setting up locking, it becomes impossible (even for an administrator) to delete the object. Combined with the (very) high availability of an object storage platform, this ensures the availability of data in the platform. 

.. note:: Object locking can be setup for a certain time. Keep in mind that depending on mode, you cannot delete the information until the time passes, meaning you will need to pay for the storage of the object until the locking has expired.

Using object locking
--------------------

To create a bucket with support for locking, follow these steps:

.. note:: Below guide will use the s3 object storage and the `aws` client. We suggest you read :doc:`our guide on the same </storage/object-storage/s3>` before proceeding. 

- Run this command to create the bucket: ``aws --endpoint=https://object-eu-se-1a.binero.cloud s3api create-bucket --bucket [BUCKET_NAME] --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=europe-se-1:gp.recurring --object-lock-enabled-for-bucket``
- Select either "COMPLIANCE" or "GOVERNANCE" as retention mode. COMPLIANCE will enforce the settings for all users (also administrators), GOVERNANCE will allow users with special privileges to remove objects or change the retention days.
- Run this command to setup locking on the bucket: ``aws --endpoint=https://object-eu-se-1a.binero.cloud s3api put-object-lock-configuration --bucket [BUCKET_NAME] --object-lock-configuration '{ "ObjectLockEnabled": "Enabled", "Rule": { "DefaultRetention": { "Mode": "COMPLIANCE", "Days": 1 }}}'``

Objects are now protected as per the policy and days chosen. See the :doc:`versioning <versioning>` documentation on how it's enforced with versions.
