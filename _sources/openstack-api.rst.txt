=============
OpenStack API
=============

The OpenStack API is available for managing your resources programatically. This is a very powerful feature for users that either want to create infrastructure as code projects or want to use
third-party platforms like `Terraform <https://www.terraform.io>`__ to manage their infrastructure. 

The OpenStack API is broken down into smaller parts based on what service is to be manipulated. They have in common that an :doc:`API user </getting-started/users>` is needed to access the API using any of the below endpoints.

We keep updated information about the release of the platform along with links to correct APIs available in our :doc:`OpenStack <openstack>` documentation.

- Function - what services in the platform the API can manage with a link to its section in our documentation.
- Service name - the name of the OpenStack feature. With this you can easily find the relevant section in the official API docks.
- API endpoint - where to connect, in order to use the implementation for the eu-se-1 region.

Version
-------

Some of the OpenStack APIs will support multiple versions for backwards compability. Generally the recommended version is included in the URL (where applicable) below but in certain cases microversions
might be required (for instance v2.1 vs v2.67 for Nova) for some functionality.

Keystone
--------

Keystone is the identity service in the OpenStack ecosystem that you use to authenticate using an :doc:`API user </getting-started/users>`.

A good place to start is available in the official documentation `here <https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/api_curl_examples.html>`_.

Authentication is needed for all API calls, when authenticating for your token a catalog with endpoints is provided in the response, for
verbosity it's also included below.
