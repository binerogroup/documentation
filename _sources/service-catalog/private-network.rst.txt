Private Network
===============
If you want to provision a new :doc:`network </networking/router/private-subnet/index>`, this convenience function will help you. Additional info on how to get started with networking is in our :doc:`/getting-started/launching-an-instance` guide. 

To setup the service, first follow the general instructions on our :doc:`index` page. Then follow these instructions: 

- Give your service a name and optionally a description.
- Select which :doc:`availability zone </compute/regions-and-availability-zones>` you want to provision in. We recommend *europe-se-1a* if you are unsure. 
- Select a :doc:`network range </networking/router/private-subnet/subnet-format>` to use. 
- Leave remaining items and press "create".
