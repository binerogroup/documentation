Grafana
=======
`Grafana <https://grafana.com>`__ is an observability platform that enables visualising and graphing various source data in a very powerful and easy manner. You also have the option to install a local (to the instance) `InfluxDB time series database <https://www.influxdata.com>`__ to use as source for your Grafana instance. 

To setup the service, first follow the general instructions on our :doc:`index` page. Then follow these instructions: 

- Give your service a name and optionally a description.
- Select which :doc:`availability zone </compute/regions-and-availability-zones>` you want to provision in. We recommend *europe-se-1a* if you are unsure. 
- If you want backup, check the "backup" checkbox and select an amount of days you would like your history stored.
- Select your instance :doc:`flavor </compute/flavors>`. We recommend sticking with the default.
- If you want to also install an InfluxDB server, check the "InfluxDB" checkbox. If you don't, you can still use Grafana to visualise data from some already existent source. 
- Select your :doc:`SSH-key </compute/ssh-keys>`. 
- Under "local network", select the :doc:`network </networking/router/private-subnet/index>` on which you want to run the service.
- If you want your service publicly available on the internet, you can assign a floating IP (this can also be done later) by checking the "public access" checkbox. If you dont, you can only access it locally in your cloud account or over some kind of VPN.
- Press "create". You will get further details on how to connect to the service.
