Compute regions and availability zones
======================================

Compute is a core service and is available in all Binero clouds regions and availability zones.

A compute instance is local to a single availability zone with no way to replicate between zones. Its however possible to move or copy an instance to another zone by
first creating and :doc:`image </images/index>` and then provisioning a new instance in the new zone based on that image.

.. note:: While its possible to use stretched networking and run images in several availability zones, keep in mind that your networking isn't reliant on a floating IP
          that is local to a single zone. More information in the :doc:`/networking/regions-and-availability-zones` article.
