Resizing an instance using OpenStack terminal client
====================================================

To resize an :doc:`instance <../index>` using the :doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/openstack-terminal-client`, follow these steps: 

.. important:: Resizing an instance will cause the instance to shut off during the process. We recommend doing a backup of your data before proceeding.

- Identify the :doc:`flavor <../flavors>` you want. This can be done by running command: ``openstack flavor list``.
- Identify the instance you want to resize. This can be done by running the following command: ``openstack server list``.
- To resize, run the following command: ``openstack server resize --flavor [FLAVOR NAME] [INSTANCE NAME]`` where you replace the items in brackets to the flavor you choose in previous step and the instance name.
- Run the command: ``openstack server list`` and you'll see the instance is now in Status "VERIFY_RESIZE". Login to the instance and verify that it worked as intended (meaning the instance is working as before but with the new flavor).
- If you are happy with the result, run the following command: ``openstack server resize confirm [INSTANCE NAME]`` This will finalise the process and make it permanent.
- If you are unhappy (for some reason the process failed), you are able to instead run the command ``openstack server resize revert [INSTANCE NAME]``. This will revert the process.

The process is now complete.
