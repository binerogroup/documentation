Resizing an instance using Cloud management portal
==================================================

To resize an `instance <../index>`_ using the :doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/cloud-management-portal`, follow these steps: 

.. important:: Resizing an instance will cause the instance to shut off during the process. We recommend doing a backup of your data before proceeding.

- Press "Compute" and then "Instances" in the sidebar menu.
- Press the instance that you want to resize.
- In the top right corner, press "resize" (its a small dotted square).
- Select the :doc:`flavor <../flavors>` you want.
- Press "Resize" and press "yes".
- You will see the status in the top left corner. 
- When it says "verify resize" (and a small triangle), login to the instance and verify that it worked as intended (meaning the instance is working as before but with the new flavor). 
- If you are happy with the result, press the small "check mark" in the top right corner. This will finalise the process and make it permanent.
- If you are unhappy (for some reason the process failed), you are able to instead press the small "x". This will revert the process.
- Accept the change by pressing "yes".

The process is now complete.
