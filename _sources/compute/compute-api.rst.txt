Manage compute using the OpenStack API
======================================

To manage compute, i.e. managing instances via the OpenStack API you need to use the Nova API. We do not provide a complete documentation for how to do API calls but rather `link to the correct official documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/api-guide/compute/>`_. 

.. note:: Please read our :doc:`general OpenStack API documentation </openstack-api>` as a good starting point for working with the API.
