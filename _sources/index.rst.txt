You can then manage your account using the :doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/account-management-portal` and control your
cloud infrastructure using the :doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/cloud-management-portal` or using the :doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/openstack-horizon`
dashboard logging in with an API user created from the cloud portal.

If you are unfamiliar with the :doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/openstack-horizon` dashboard, we recommended you use the :doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/cloud-management-portal`
as it will greatly simplify your user experience.

There are advanced features (as described in this documentation) in the platform that will require using :doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/openstack-horizon`, the
:doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/openstack-terminal-client` or the :doc:`/openstack-api`.

The Horizon dashboard is documented in great detail `here <https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest/user/index.html>`__ and will not be covered exhaustively in this documentation.
