Launching a load balancer
=========================

.. note:: Before launching your first load balancer, we strongly recommend reading our :doc:`concepts <../general-concept/index>` guide so as to understand the various parts.

We also suggest our :doc:`recommendations for load balancing <../recommendations>` article for some general tips that might improve your load balancing implementation. 

To create a load balancer in Binero cloud, you have three main options as outlined in the links below. Each option have its pros and cons:

- :doc:`The cloud management portal <cloud-management-portal>` is very easy to use and will get a user with limited prior knowledge from A to B quickly. The tradeoff is that advanced features are not always available.
- :doc:`OpenStack Horizon <openstack-horizon>` is the web interface included in OpenStack. Some advanced features might only have a GUI implementation here.
- :doc:`The OpenStack terminal client <openstack-terminal-client>` is a command line implementation of OpenStack Horizon giving terminal oriented users a (very) quick way to access the cloud. The learning curve is steeper than the GUI implementation but the workflow will be very efficient.
