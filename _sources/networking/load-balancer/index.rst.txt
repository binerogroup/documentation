=============
Load Balancer
=============

Binero cloud provides a managed load balancer service that you can use when `scaling </compute/resizing-an-instance/index.html#scaling-methods>`_ and making
your application more resilient and highly available with little effort for you.

The service handles the ingress traffic and requests to your application with support for healthchecks. See the :doc:`general-concept/index` for more
details on how the service works.

The load balancer service is based upon well-established open source projects `HAProxy <https://www.haproxy.org>`_ and `Keepalived <https://www.keepalived.org>`_ and
all load balancers created is highly available and redundant. Binero handles security and patching of your load balancer infrastructure at no extra cost.

You can manage your load balancers using the :doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/cloud-management-portal`, :doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/openstack-horizon`,
:doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/openstack-terminal-client` or the API.

The load balancer service is available in all our :doc:`availability zones </regions-and-availability-zones>`.

.. note:: If availability zone is selected it will always default to the **europe-se-1a** availability zone.

.. note:: The load balancer service requires a :doc:`router <../router/index>` and members on a :doc:`private subnet <../router/private-subnet/index>` to use.

.. caution:: Please note that availability zone on a :doc:`index` only selects where the load balancer is located and the incoming traffic
             from the internet will still go through the availability zone that the :doc:`/networking/router/index` is in.
