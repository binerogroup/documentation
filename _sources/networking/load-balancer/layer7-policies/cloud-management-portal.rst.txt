Creating a Layer7 policy using the Cloud management portal
==========================================================
We recommend first reading our :doc:`guide <index>` on layer 7 policies to get a better understanding of how they work. To create a layer 7 policy using the :doc:`cloud management portal </getting-started/managing-your-cloud/cloud-management-portal>`, follow these steps: 

- Press "Networking" and then "Load balancers" in the sidebar menu.
- Press the load balancer on which you want to add the rule.
- Press the "listeners" tab and then the name of the listener to which you want to add the policy.
- Press the "L7 policys" tab.
- Press the "+" button.
- Name your policy and optionally provide a description.
- Select your action and if applicable, provide a value (e.g. what domain to redirect to). 
- Select a priority (1 is the lowest).
- Check "admin state up" assuming you want the rule to go live at once.
- Press "create". 

Once you've created a policy, you will also want to create a rule which triggers it. To do this, follow these steps:

- Press the newly created policys name. 
- Press the "L7 Rules" tab.
- Press the "+" button.
- Choose the type and if applicable, also input the key value. 
- Choose compare type and input value for comparison.
- Check "admin state up" assuming you want the rule to go live at once.
- Press "create". 

After some time to provision (when the "Operationell status" says "ONLINE"), the rule is live.
