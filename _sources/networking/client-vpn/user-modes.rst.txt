User modes
==========

While there are several modes of operation possible on the VPN, there are two main modes that we recommend, the difference being wether to require individual user authentication. Both modes will provide :doc:`strong encryption <security-settings>` but aims to provide solutions for different use-cases. 

Default configuration
---------------------

In its default configuration, the VPN service does not rely on user accounts but rather a certificate and a TLS key which is shared among its clients. This is a very easy starting point as a VPN config can simply be shared amongst users and will be identical to all, no user management is required and getting one or more users enrolled to the VPN is as quick as importing the configuration into the client and hitting connect. Once connected, it will provide a secure communication to the inside network where authentication would (most likely) still enforce a username and password (or key). Having a VPN greatly simplifies :doc:`connecting to your instances <../reaching-your-instances>` and communication is secure.

A potential downside to this setup is that its impossible to offboard a user from the VPN that have the configuration already setup without changing the certificates and/or the TLS key for all users that should retain connectivity. In the event the internal authentication protocols (once connected to the VPN) are not considered a strong enough security level, this then becomes a cumbersome process when for instance an employee leaves or a consultant stops working on a project where, had there been user authentication, you would simply remove the user. 

Its worth to mention, however, that a security minded organisation will roll certificates and keys from time to time anyhow, which would result in new client configuration having to be imported on the end users computers.

Individual users
----------------

An alternative way to authenticate users is by setting up individual users with passwords and unique certificates for another layer of security. A user can then be removed should the need arise and there is then no need to replace the certificates and keys for all users. 

To change the operating mode to include user authentication, using the VPN WebGUI, follow these steps:

- :doc:`Login <initial-configuration>` to the VPN management interface.
- Press "VPN" and then "OpenVPN" in the main menu.
- Click the small pen symbol (edit server) on the only row (assuming you have not added more servers) under "OpenVPN servers". 
- Under section "Mode configuration" (close to the top), change "Server mode" to ``Remote Access ( SSL/TLS + User Auth )``
- Scroll down to "Duplicate Connection" under section "Tunnel settings" and disable it (by removing the checkbox) if you only want to allow one simultaneous connection per user. This will enforce that a single user is not sharing their login (willingly or otherwise) as just a single login at the time, per user account, is allowed. 
- Press "Save" at the bottom.

You are now ready to :doc:`create some users <managing-users>` to login to your VPN. 

.. important:: If you've previously used the default mode, you will need to ensure that you also :doc:`update your client configuration <logging-in>` before logging in again. The configuration will be different on the client side and other certificates will be used.

.. note:: When removing a user, it will not automatically be de-authenticated and logged out but rather cannot log back in once disconnected. It is however possible to do manual de-auth via the web interface under "status" -> "openvpn".
