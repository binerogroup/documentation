Adding rules to a security group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add rules to a :doc:`security group <index>` using the :doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/cloud-management-portal`, follow these steps: 

- Press "Networking" and then "Security groups" in the sidebar menu.
- On the security group you want to add a rule to, press the small "create rule" icon (looks like several rows of text with a small "+" sign).
- Define the rule. More info in our :doc:`designing-rules` article.
- Press "create rule".

.. note:: For ease of use, we recommend using the already defined rules. These are project specific so you can also tweak them as you see fit.

- In the top tab (under the instance name), security groups menu is available when scrolling to the right. Press it.
- Press "Allocate".
- Select the group you want to add.
