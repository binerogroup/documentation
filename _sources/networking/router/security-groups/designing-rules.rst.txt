Designing security group rules
==============================

Recommendations
---------------

Below are some key points to take into consideration when designing security group rules (firewall rules) in Binero cloud that will lead to a more secure platform.

- Its recommended to make the rule as specific (granular) as possible. If you (for instance) want to give access to a web-server, then just add a rule for http (tcp/80) and https (tcp/443). Dont also allow access to udp and / or any other ports.
- Lock down the source IP when the rule is for management (so if it exposes services that are not needed to be exposed to provide your service) . Only leave rules that give access to (internet facing) services with the "any" source.
- Use the custom rules that enables you to add a destination port. Don't use the "all ports" feature even if its internal. Its a big gain in security to just add access to the services that in fact need to be reached on all hosts as vulnerable services are one of the biggest reasons for IT-intrusion. The fewer exposed, the better (also internally).
- Since you apply your rules on a per instance basis you wont set a destination when creating rules. The destination (or source if its an egress rule) is defined by what instances you add your security groups to. Take care to not add a rule to an instance that gives to much access. Rather create more security groups with more granular rules so that you minimise your instances exposure. 
- Remember egress or ingress (more info on the :doc:`index` page). Generally speaking, the security is lessened by adding ingress rules that provide access so design these to have a specific purpose. 
- If you still have the `default group <index.html#default-settings>`__ activated on your instances, you do not also need to provide access for your internal systems to reach each other. For an easier setup, we recommend keeping the default group (as it will emulate a traditional network where all local machines will reach each other). For a more secure solution, we recommend also adding security groups for internal access and removing the default group. *We do not recommending mixing the two options as that will be a less predictable (and therefore harder to understand) design*.  
- When doing multiple subnets to allow for different security zones (the need for this is negated by using proper security groups that replace the default group as that will give you security between your instances on the same network as well), remember that the default group will leave your internal networks open to each other even though they are traversing a router.
- Create security groups based on use cases. A use case might be "web server" and another might be "database server". The rules for each use case should be designed with the instance type in mind. Remember that its possible to add multiple security groups to any instance. Its easier (and less clear / more predictable) to have multiple, very granular groups instead of a single, very complex group.
- "0.0.0.0/0" means "all of the internet" when using it as a destination. We only recommend using this to provide access to a service that should indeed be globally reachable.
- Rules are by default stateful. This means that if a request is sent and accepted, the *return traffic* (that is: the traffic that the answering service sends as a reply to the request) is also allowed, irrespectively of wether that traffic flow is explicitly defined. This is a standard behaviour in a firewall. If you want to create a non stateful (stateless) rule, you can create the group using the :doc:`terminal client <openstack-terminal-client>` and the flag ``--stateless``. A stateless rule would only work in a single direction (egress or ingress). We generally recommend stateful rules but for some use-cases (for instance asymmetrical routing where you would not send the return traffic the same path), stateless rules might be required.

.. tip:: The best way to ensure that you have correctly applied your rules is by testing. This is ideally done using the linux program "nmap" that can do a port-scan. For instance ``nmap -T4 1.2.3.4`` would scan the server with IP 1.2.3.4 (the -T4 flag limits the timeout per port to 10 ms which speeds up the otherwise slow process). The output will be a list of open ports. Keep in mind to scan both from the inside (using your various internal instances against their internal IPs) as well as using for instance your workstation (against the floating IPs that expose your services) to get the "internet perspective". We recommend doing scans after setting up or changing your security groups to make sure the actual result was what was expected. 

Available parameters
--------------------

The following section shows what parameters you can use to create security groups. Please note that not all parameters will be available from the GUI, some may require the :doc:`terminal client <openstack-terminal-client>` to use. The terminal option is added within parentheses.

- Remote IP (--remote-ip) - Remote IP address or IP range (may use :doc:`CIDR notation <../private-subnet/subnet-format>`; default for IPv4 rule: 0.0.0.0/0, default for IPv6 rule: ::/0).
- Remote Group (--remote-group) - Remote security group (name or ID). Instead of IP, you could use a remote group to decide from where the traffic originates.
- Destination port (--dst-port) - Destination port, may be a single port or a starting and ending port range: 137:139. Required for IP protocols TCP and UDP. Ignored for ICMP IP protocols.
- Protocol (--protocol) - IP protocol (ah, dccp, egp, esp, gre, icmp, igmp, ipv6-encap, ipv6-frag, ipv6-icmp, ipv6-nonxt, ipv6-opts, ipv6-route, ospf, pgm, rsvp, sctp, tcp, udp, udplite, vrrp and integer representations [0-255] or any; default: any (all protocols)).
- ICMP typ (--icmp-type) - ICMP type for ICMP IP protocols.
- ICMP code (--icmp-code) - ICMP code for ICMP IP protocols.
- Direction (--ingress / --egress) - Rule applies to incoming or outgoing network traffic (incoming is default).
- IP version (--ethertype) - whether to use IPv4 or IPv6; default is based on IP protocol.
