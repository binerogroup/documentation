Launching routers using the OpenStack terminal client
=====================================================

To launch a `router <../index>`_ from the :doc:`/getting-started/managing-your-cloud/openstack-terminal-client`, follow these steps: 

- Run ``openstack availability zone list --network --long``, this will give you the current availability zones for routers and networking, to create the router we will need to select an availability zone for it. Save the name of the availability zone (with zone resource "router") you want to use for following step. If you are unsure, always use "europe-se-1a".
- Run ``openstack network list --external``, this will show the available external networks. Save this for next step.
- Run ``openstack router create --availability-zone-hint=[AVAILABILITY ZONE] --external-gateway=[NETWORK-NAME] [ROUTER NAME]``. Replace the items within brackets with the values from previous sections as well as the name of the router. Keep in mind to use the network that corresponds to the availability zone you chose. If you are not sure what availability zone to use, we recommend using *europe-se-1a*.

.. note:: In order to connect instances to the router, it will also need a :doc:`network <../private-network/index>` and a :doc:`subnet <../private-subnet/index>` configured.
