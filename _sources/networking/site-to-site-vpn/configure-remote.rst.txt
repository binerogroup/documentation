==========================
Configuring the remote end
==========================

Part of the tunnel runs on Binero cloud but the other part runs on the site that you want to connect to. It is difficult to write a comprehensive documentation on how to setup the remote part of the tunnel as the equipment used could vary but normally the options that need editing are the same. IPSec will only work with identical settings on both ends so take care to setup the remove end point with **exactly** the same settings (as outlined below). 

Keep in mind that for your tunnel to be able to initiate from both ends, you will need to allow traffic from the remote endpoint to your firewall. Either open up from all traffic from the remote endpoint IP (and *protocols* as IPSEC uses more than a single protocol) or do a selective firewall opening for the following:

- Protocol ESP
- Protocol AH
- Port 4500/UDP
- Port 500/UDP

The below steps should provide the information needed to get a tunnel up and running, however we recommend reading the official documentation from your vendor on how to configure.

- ``Key exchange version``: IKEv2
- ``Remote gateway`` + ``Peer identifier``: The floating IP address of our local pfSense instance (provided by the output value ``ipsec_endpoint`` of the IPSec service).
- ``Authentication method`` PSK
- ``Pre-shared key``: The pre-shared key that was either chosen by you or generated while creating the pfSense instance (provided by the output value ``ipsec_psk`` of the IPSec service).
- Phase 1 configuration:

  - ``SA lifetime``: 28800 seconds
  - ``Dead peer detection (DPD)``: Enabled
  - ``Algorithms``: Binero cloud supports (by default) two options for phase 1 encryption. We recommend the first option as it is more secure but we provide support for a second option for compatibility with older hardware. If you need to change to an even more insecure cipher, please edit the phase 1 configuration in the management interface. See :doc:`advanced-configuration` for more information.
  - Alternative 1:

    - ``Cipher``: AES-256-GCM with 128-bit ICV (also known as AES-GCM-16)
    - ``Pseudo-random function (PRF)``: Auto / SHA2_384 (this can often be left as auto, if there is not an option for it available, assume its automatically chosen).
    - ``(Integrity) Hash``: SHA2_384 (may not be required by all vendors)
    - ``Diffie-Hellman (DH)-Group``: 20 (NIST ecp384)

  - Alternative 2:

    - ``Cipher``: AES-CBC-256
    - ``Pseudo-random function (PRF)``: Not used (not relevant)
    - ``(Integrity) Hash``: SHA2_384
    - ``Diffie Hellman (DH) Group``: 15 (modp3072)

- Phase 2 configuration:

  - ``Remote network``: Your local private network
  - ``Protocol``: ESP
  - ``Lifetime``: 3600 seconds
  - ``Algorithms``: Binero cloud supports (by default) two options for phase 2 encryption. We recommend the first option as it is more secure but we provide support for a second option for compatibility with older hardware. If you need to change to an even more insecure cipher, please edit the phase 2 configuration in the management interface. See :doc:`advanced-configuration` for more information.
  - Alterative 1:

    - ``Cipher``: AES-256-GCM with 128-bit ICV (also known as AES-GCM-16)
    - ``(Integrity) Hash``: SHA2_384 (may not be required by all vendors)
    - ``Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) key group``: 15 (modp3072)
  
  - Alterative 2:
  
    - ``Cipher``: AES-CBC-256
    - ``(Integrity) Hash``: SHA2_384
    - ``Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) key group``: Not used (not relevant)
