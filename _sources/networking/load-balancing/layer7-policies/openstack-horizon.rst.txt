Creating a Layer7 policy using OpenStack Horizon
================================================
We recommend first reading our :doc:`guide <index>` on layer 7 policies to get a better understanding of how they work. To create a layer 7 policy using the :doc:`OpenStack Horizon portal </getting-started/managing-your-cloud/openstack-horizon>`, follow these steps: 

- Under "project", click "Network" and then "Load balancers" in the sidebar menu.
- Press the name of the load balancer on which you want to add the rule.
- Press the "listeners" tab and then the name of the listener to which you want to add the policy.
- Press the "L7 policys" tab.
- Press the "Create L7 Policy" button in the top right. 
- Name your policy and optionally provide a description.
- Select your action and if applicable, provide a value (e.g. what domain to redirect to). 
- Select a position (1 is the lowest).
- Press "Create L7 Policy".

Once you've created a policy, you will also want to create a rule which triggers it. To do this, follow these steps:

- Press the newly created policys name. 
- Press the "L7 Rules" tab.
- Press the "+ Create L7 Rule" button.
- Choose the type and if applicable, also input the key value. 
- Choose compare type and input value for comparison.
- Press "create L7 rule". 

After some time to provision (when the "Operating Status" says "Online"), the rule is live.
