======================================
Manage compute using the OpenStack API
======================================

To manage compute for example managing instances via the OpenStack API you need
to use the Nova API.

We do not provide a complete documentation for how to do API calls but
rather `link to the official documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/api-guide/compute/>`_. 

.. note::

   Read our :doc:`general OpenStack API documentation </openstack-api>` as a good starting
   point for working with the API.
