Flavors
=======

Binero cloud provides various flavors of compute instances. A flavor defines the compute, memory,
storage capacity for some flavors (see NVMe flavors below) and other hardware configuration that
allows you to customize for performance or features needed by your application.

There are different groups of flavors and each group has different performance characteristics
and is optimized for different use-cases.

Each group of flavors has a version number meaning the higher version number the newer the
hardware giving a performance advatange on previous versions, for flavors without an explicit
version number in the name is implied to be version 1.

A flavor can have specific features such as NVMe storage, GPU, Pinned CPU. A CPU vendor identifier is
added as a suffix to the flavor name, the CPU vendor identifiers is listed below.

- ``a`` for AMD (amd64)

- ``i`` for Intel (x86_64) â€“ **Intel is implied for version 1**

- ``r`` for ARM (ARM64/AARCH64)

An overview of the flavor groups and their types looks like below.

- General purpose

  - version 1 (flavors without a version number) where Intel is implied, example ``gp.2x4``

    - Pinned CPU for CPU intensive workload (dedicated CPU), example ``gp.4x8-pinned``

  - version 2 with AMD (CPU vendor identifier is ``a``), example ``gp-v2a.2x4``

- High memory

  - version 1 (flavors without a version number) where Intel is implied, example ``hm.2x8``

    - Pinned CPU for CPU intensive workload (dedicated CPU), example ``hm.8x32-pinned``

  - version 2 with AMD (CPU vendor identifier is ``a``), example ``hm-v2a.2x8``

- High performance

  - version 1 (flavors without a version number) where Intel is implied, example ``hp.8x32``

    - GPU, example ``hp.8x24-gpu4`` where the number after GPU means 4 GB vRAM

    - NVMe storage, example ``hp.4x8-nvme50`` where the number after NVMe means 50 GB disk

    - GPU and NVMe, example ``hp.12x64-gpu8-nvme250``

The names are designed to be easy to understand with a clear structure, for example the
flavor ``hm.8x48`` is a High memory (hm) version 1 using Intel CPUs with 8 vCPUs and 48
GB memory.

The ``hp.12x64-gpu8-nvme50`` flavor is High performance (hp) version 1 with 12 vCPUs,
64 GB memory, 8 GB GPU vRAM and 50 GB of local NVMe storage.

The ``gp-v2a.8x16`` flavor is Generala purpose (gp) version 2 with 8 vCPUs and 16 GB
memory.

The flavors are presented more in detail below, you can also see them in the various portals
or by listing them using the OpenStack terminal client with ``openstack flavor list --sort-column Name``

.. note::

   All gigahertz (GHz) specifications for processors is based on base clock
   frequency in the product specification and does not take into account that
   your workload can be faster due to Intel Turbo boost or AMD Boost clock
   functionality provided by processors.

General purpose
---------------

This general purpose flavor group has a well rounded combination of CPU and memory and is suitable
for most general application use-cases that does not have heavy or intensive CPU requirements.

This flavor group provides a very good cost for performance and is recommended for use-cases
with low to medium usage requirements.

Version 1 with Intel CPU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The version number 1 (implied in the flavor names) is using Intel as CPU vendor
with Intel Xeon Gold 6138 2.0 GHz prcessors from the Intel Xeon Scalable Processors
product family.

.. tip::

   If you are looking for a larger flavor or more performance, see the General purpose
   version 2 flavors with AMD that is larger and has 1-4x the performance based on your
   use-case.

Pinned CPU
^^^^^^^^^^

These flavors gives you gives you a pinned CPU, this means that your vCPU is pinned to a
dedicated CPU core (pCPU) giving you exclusive access to the computation time on that core.

In certain use-cases guaranteeing low-latency and fast access to CPU computation time is
critical for time sensitive applications that would normally suffer when scheduling of CPU
time to shared CPU cores takes more time than the requirement causing the application to
experience lag or higher tail latencies due to for example noisy neighbours.

We also guarantee that the allocated CPU core thread sibblings is allocated so that you're
never exposed to any transient execution CPU vulnerabilities.

We allocate pinned CPUs across all NUMA nodes to optimize CPU usage but due to memory being
local to a NUMA node we recommend ultra sensitive workloads to not run its workload on
multiple different cores if low-latency memory access is a requirement as that will traverse
NUMA nodes to read memory.

.. tip::

   See the High memory version 1 pinned CPU flavors for the same feature but with
   a higher memory to CPU ratio.

High memory
-----------

This high memory flavor group is optimized to provide the best value for applications that
needs a larger amount of memory compared to more CPU cores that is provided by general purpose.

The flavor group can be used for more memory heavy use-cases such as a database application with
heavy caching of the dataset in memory that doesn't have a intensive requirement on CPU computation.

Version 1 with Intel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The version number 1 (implied in the flavor names) is using Intel as CPU vendor
with Intel Xeon Gold 6138 2.0 GHz prcessors from the Intel Xeon Scalable Processors
product family.

.. tip::

High performance
----------------

This high performance flavor group is optimized for applications with a heavy and/or intensive
CPU requirements. This results in faster task completion, a faster and more predictable access
to both memory and storage giving you a lower latency.

The flavor group can be used for more CPU intensive applications causing your workload to
run and complete faster improving serial throughput, use-cases such as caching servers or
heavily utilized database applications or other application that needs more performance
and lower latency.

The flavor sizes is more rounded to being equal in CPU and memory.

Version 1 with Intel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The version number 1 (implied in the flavor names) is using Intel as CPU vendor
with Intel Xeon Gold 6154 3.0 GHz prcessors from the Intel Xeon Scalable Processors
product family.

.. tip::

   The High performance version 1 has a 50% higher base clock frequency than version 1
   of General purpose and High memory flavor groups and can significally improve your
   performance for CPU heavy or latency sensitive workloads.

NVMe storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^

These flavors provides local ephemeral :doc:`NVMe based storage </storage/nvme-storage>` with
very high performance and low-latency access times, with the limitation of being local there
is no data redundancy.

.. caution::

   The NVMe based storage is local to the hypervisor that is running your
   instance and is backed by a single physical disk, though NVMe based
   enterprise solid state drives has an extremely good lifetime expectancy it's
   very important that you consider this fact and **backup your data** regularly.

This flavor provides the best possible storage performance for IO intensive workloads
that needs to write to disk and is great for ephemeral storage or as disk if you
have an application with data replication or redundancy already builtin.

GPU
^^^

These flavors provides :doc:`GPU based compute <gpu-instances>` and allows gives you a
GPU allocated to your instance with the specified vRAM/vMEM memory.

This gives you access to a NVIDIA A10 GPU that you can use for rendering, image
processing, AI, ML and inferrence workloads that can run 50-200x faster on a GPU
than a CPU.

.. tip::

   If you also need local NVMe storage for your GPU workload, see the GPU with NVMe
   flavors further down.
